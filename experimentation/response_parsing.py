The chair recognizes Councillor Royo, chair of the Committee on Government Operations, Councillor Royo. \nSPEAKER_05:  of the floor. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Mr. Chair. The committee on government operations, how the working session on Monday, April 4th, on Docket 0321 petition for a special law regarding securing environmental justice in the City of Boston, which was sponsored by Councillor Liddy Edwards. I'd like to thank my council colleagues for attending, Councillor Flynn, Councillor Lara, Councillor Mejia, Councillor Murphy, Councillor Flarety, Councillor Bock, and Councillor Wereld. \nSPEAKER_05:  This home role petition would declare that a state of emergency exists in the city of Boston with regards to environmental injustice and climate change. \nSPEAKER_05:  If passed, this legislation would amend the BPDAs enabling action to remove public services corporations' ability to seek an exemption to all Boston's own laws by petitioning the State Department of Public Utilities. Instead, this legislation will give the Building Commission or the authority to enforce environmental justice standards if the Commissioner determines that a use or proposed use of a building structure or land in the city would negatively impact environmental rights afforded to residents by state law. The Building Commissioner would have the authority to issue a stock work order or suspend any issued permits, licenses, or authorizations. Associated with the use or proposed use at the working session, the Committee heard from several environmental justice advocates about the urgency of securing environmental justice in Boston. \nSPEAKER_05:  and protecting local communities, the utility company representative stated that they believe that existing state regulations provided sufficient environmental justice protections. The sponsor clarified that the legislation \nSPEAKER_05:  would grant extra authority to the Building Commissioner. \nSPEAKER_05:  And that more specific building standards can be crafted by the zoning commission and the building commissioner of the state passes this. There was a suggestion or language be added specifying that the process of deciding those building standards shall be guided by the needs of community through a civic engagement process. So while we wait to receive specific language amendments that were discussed at the working session, we're recommending that this remains in committee. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Mr. Consul. Royal. Wouldn't any of our colleagues like to speak in this matter? \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you Ms. Collins. \nSPEAKER_10:  Do I get zero, three, two, one? \nSPEAKER_10:  We'll remain in committee. Mr. Clerk, please read, docket 0295. \nSPEAKER_09:  Talking to Number 0295, order for a hearing to explore municipal bonds and other fiscal options to increase affordable housing and community investments. \nSPEAKER_10:  The chair recognizes council of Fernandez Anderson, chair of the committee and ways and means council of Fernandez Anderson, you have the floor. \nSPEAKER_03:  Can we refer our backs out? \nSPEAKER_03:  I love my before. \nSPEAKER_10:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Mr. Clerk, can we go on to docket 0 3 1 3 and we'll return to \nSPEAKER_10:  Dock at 0295. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Talking number zero. \nSPEAKER_09:  313, message an order for an appropriation order in the amount of \nSPEAKER_09:  27,200,000. \nSPEAKER_09:  $5,854.

I want to thank my colleagues who join me and I'll see a special thank you to the vice chair, Councillor Kinsey-Bock, who helped finish out the hearing with the Zoom testimony, as well as central staff who worked late to accommodate the evening \nSPEAKER_08:  hearing. As someone who led the efforts on this body to help get CPA passed along with some of my colleagues \nSPEAKER_08:  and many, many constituents and advocates in voters across the city. This hearing is my favorite hearing each year. It's the opportunity for us to see \nSPEAKER_08:  a great program evolved. \nSPEAKER_08:  I continue to grow and you see more folks get excited about it. I think you referenced it last night and after you had left other folks that spoke, I'd reference your comments about talking about something that just brings people and brings communities together. It's the CPA as I believe in vision. With that said, we heard following testimony from Marien Garso, we heard from Chief Dylan, Deputy Director Jessica Boatwright, Chief Mary M. Hammond, Ryan Woods, the Commissioner of Parks, Courtney Whalen and Julian Lang from historic preservation and last but not least the Stating Brown Deputy Director of the Community Preservation. \nSPEAKER_08:  and she did, she does a phenomenal job as referenced and also. \nSPEAKER_08:  folks that testified. \nSPEAKER_08:  Talk about how they didn't make some feel like they're the only applicant. \nSPEAKER_08:  and she goes to Great Lakes to make sure that they have all the information in Ducks and Lines. \nSPEAKER_08:  in that whatever is missing or her outreach as well. Can we do better, always, we can always. \nSPEAKER_08:  If any program in the city is working and is reaching out as best they can, it's this group and they'll continue to do so as referenced by our colleagues' questions last night. The breakdown is as follows, 27 million in change will go 14,660,159 dollars will go to affordable housing projects, 6,141,357 dollars will go to historic preservation projects, 6,400,338 in recreational use and open space projects. So to date, that over 92 million has been awarded to 198 projects spanning across the city. \nSPEAKER_08:  with the approval of this appropriation. \nSPEAKER_08:  will be awarding $119 million over to 250 projects since the funding. \nSPEAKER_08:  begin in 2018. So during the course of the hearing we had robust public testimony in favor of the of the proposed project, of all of them very deserving including testimony from some of our youngest residents in the city advocating for projects that impacted their school, their community, and others. As chair of the committee, I'd like this manager, a remaining committee just to allow for some further public comment given that the hearing went late. \nSPEAKER_08:  and we want to make sure that folks that want the opportunity to advocate on behalf of \nSPEAKER_08:  These three buckets of affordable housing, historic preservation and open space have the opportunity to do so. In which case I look forward to putting a committee put together for this party to consider to vote on next Wednesday. If any of my other colleagues through the chair would like to speak, they're happy to accommodate that and we'll have this thing turn around by next Wednesday. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you, Mr. President. \nSPEAKER_10:  and \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Councilor Fliherty. \nSPEAKER_10:  Any of our colleagues like to speak on this matter? \nSPEAKER_10:  I just want to say thank you to Councillor Flaherty and Councillor Bock. \nSPEAKER_10:  Central staff, the mayor's office that was here last night. \nSPEAKER_10:  working late. \nSPEAKER_10:  We appreciate everything. \nSPEAKER_10:  and you'll lead a ship on this important show. \nSPEAKER_10:  as Councillor Flarelli highlighted the Community Preservation Act. \nSPEAKER_10:  is an opportunity for neighbors to come together. \nSPEAKER_10:  Work with City officials. \nSPEAKER_10:  We're in about city government and also improve. \nSPEAKER_10:  quality of life of the enabled, so it's a tremendous program. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Council. The clarity. Dock at 0313. \nSPEAKER_10:  will remain in committee. \nSPEAKER_10:  We're moving on to... \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Council for Anderson. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um. \nSPEAKER_10:  Mr. Clerk, can you please read docket 02? \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  9-5, please. Dr. Numbers. \nSPEAKER_09:  0295, order for a hearing to explore. \nSPEAKER_09:  Enisple bonds and other fiscal options to increase affordable housing and community investments. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  The Chair recognizes Council of Fernandez-Annesan, Chair of the Committee on Ways and Means, Council of Fernandez-Annesan. You have the floor. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you, Mr. President. The chair, the Committee on Ways and Means held a hearing to explore a prospect of \nSPEAKER_03:  opportunities for \nSPEAKER_03:  more housing or creating more affordable housing. \nSPEAKER_03:  by way of bonds and we \nSPEAKER_03:  I'd like to thank the administration. I'd like to thank the \nSPEAKER_03:  my lead, the lead co-sponsor or the lead sponsor and my lead and my co-sponsor. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm \nSPEAKER_03:  on this hearing and \nSPEAKER_03:  It will remain in basically will remain committee and we just basically had a robust conversation about the possibilities, administration broke down what bonds was. \nSPEAKER_03:  They gave us a lot of back and forth, not back and forth, but explanations as to \nSPEAKER_03:  what the risks are and in terms of \nSPEAKER_03:  what the possibilities are. They say they would go back to us with projections of what those numbers actually look like. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't know if my \nSPEAKER_03:  co-sponsors like to say anything else about it, but I think that \nSPEAKER_03:  we definitely saw a possibility of exploring bonds and will \nSPEAKER_03:  be happy to report more as we go. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Councilor Fernandez-Anneson. \nSPEAKER_10:  Would any of our colleagues like to speak on this matter? \nSPEAKER_10:  that she recognizes Councillor Luzgeon. \nSPEAKER_10:  You have the floor? \nSPEAKER_07:  conversation yesterday around bonds. I want to thank the administration. \nSPEAKER_07:  I just stare at Maureen Garso and Jim Lewis and Williamson. We came and we talked about bonds. We talked about our general debt policy, but also about what would it look like to increase our debt service or to actually change our repayment schedule so that our bond repayments are a smaller fraction of our overall budget, which gives flexibility to do a lot more. We obviously have been as a city always touting this triple A bond raising, which a lot of us are very proud of the city, but a lot of that is built on a strong economy that is often entrenched in equities in our city. And so exploring ways in which we can actually \nSPEAKER_07:  Ah. \nSPEAKER_07:  attack these issues like affordable housing, like community investments, like more infrastructure in neighborhoods that have been forgotten and excluded and leading into our fiscal strength. \nSPEAKER_07:  through our bond policy is one way to do that. So I want to thank. \nSPEAKER_07:  Everyone who participated in that conversation, you, President Flynn, Councilor Mahia. \nSPEAKER_07:  and we're out. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um \nSPEAKER_07:  Obviously my co-sponsors Councillor Bach and Councillor Fernandes and Anderson both of whom have presented really great ideas around housing and how we can use combined our city's fiscal strength with whether it's what we need to do under the Faircloth Amendment to get more social housing bills or rental home options. I think this really does present us with a really great opportunity to pay for and do the things that we need to do in community to address the urgency of the crises that we're facing here to the city. So it's just the beginning of a conversation and I think the chair holding it and everyone who leaned into it because I know we can seem pretty dry like bond policy but it is really important. It's how we pay for a lot of things that we need to get done so I appreciate the scaring and look forward to further conversations. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Councilor John. \nSPEAKER_07:  Oh, and also just want to thank Councillor former City Councilor Josh Seikham and Professor Ben Bradmo who \nSPEAKER_07:  came and provided really great testimony. And really, I think did a great job of \nSPEAKER_07:  of centering the urgency of the issues we face and how our bond policy can be a tool here. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Councilor John. The Chair recognizes Councillor Bock. Councillor Bock, you're up the floor. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you so much, Mr. President, and thank you also to my co-sponsors, Councillor Fernandez Anderson and Councillor Louie Jenner, the lead sponsor. This was a great hearing to have. I want to summarize it because they put them so. \nSPEAKER_00:  So well, but it's just exciting to me. You know, the last time we were having a version of this conversation, it was last term. \nSPEAKER_00:  The mayor was a co-sponsor on that and so I think that you know talking to our ANF team and seeing the kind of desire and willingness and the council to really bond for housing in a new and robust way. I think like the stars are aligning I hope for us to really talk about that at scale in Boston and I just want to stress in this forum that you know when you look at the West Coast cities LA San Francisco Portland many of which are in very similar acute housing situations as us each of them in the last five years have put out bonds for a billion dollars on housing \nSPEAKER_00:  And I just think that, you know, in the same way that we talked about bonding for, you know, a billion dollars over 10 years for BPS with the Bill of BPS strategy. I think the time has come to talk about that here. And I think that the reality is that there are ways to adjust our policy and even within our policy some of our efficiencies in getting capital spending to actually happen in ways to kind of make room for that type of serious investment. And so. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, just really grateful to the colleagues for \nSPEAKER_00:  relaunching this conversation and as everyone knows I think we should be in the business of building more public housing in the city and that we can We're authorized by the feds to build another 2500 units. So I hope this is a conversation that we can have aggressively and move forward in the coming months. So thank you, Mr. President. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Council Bob. \nSPEAKER_10:  Anyone else like to speak on this matter? \nSPEAKER_10:  at this time. \nSPEAKER_10:  Dark at 0295 \nSPEAKER_10:  We'll remain in committee. \nSPEAKER_10:  We're going on to... \nSPEAKER_10:  We're going on to motions, orders, and resolutions, Mr. Corrick. \nSPEAKER_10:  Please read our could 0 4 6 5. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Dock in the middle for six five counselors were all in Louisiana off of the following petition for a special law relative to enact authorizing additional licenses for the sale of alcoholic beverages to be drunk on the premises and Boston. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. The chair recognizes Councillor Rell. Councillor Rell, you have the floor. I'd like to suspend an ad. \nSPEAKER_06:  Royal to the Docket. \nSPEAKER_10:  Seeing and hearing no objections, Council Royo was added as the original third co-sponsor. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you President Flynn and thank you to my co-sponsors, Councillor Louie Jen and Councillor Royo. I also want to acknowledge the work that Congresswoman Presley has done on liquor licenses here in the city of Boston. Out of the 1,448 liquor licenses in the city, only two restaurants have liquor licenses in Madapen and only six on Blue Her Lav. In this home mood petition we are being intentional by creating. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Lick of licenses for those established restaurants and neighborhoods of Dorchester, Hyde Park, and Maddie Pan. Because we must do more and create equity in liquor licenses. I must submit this home-wool petition. It's a little selfish of me. Because like many of other residents, I too want to be able to eat, watch the game, and enjoy your Don Julio resposado, meat, and my own neighborhood. \nSPEAKER_06:  Lick and license in these areas will help our small locally-owned restaurants reestablish themselves after coming through a negative impact of COVID-19. This is an opportunity for us to use our powers to help create local revenue and local jobs and create a clear pathway to small business owners to recover. \nSPEAKER_06:  Through the creation and capacity-sized liquor licenses, we are a helpful, small restaurant established by an interesting fish machine. \nSPEAKER_06:  generating the revenue to expand and the ability to create more jobs in our neighborhoods. This is why we must make sure we increase all liquor licenses each year. It's about the economic health of all our neighborhoods. I'm looking forward to discussion and on the discussion around what is the correct amount of liquor license needed. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Councilor Wirl. \nSPEAKER_10:  that she recognizes consul of Gen, consul of Gen, you have the floor. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you, Mr. President, and I just want to thank Councilor Arral for introducing this home role petition. It's really important that we do everything we can. Like Councilor Arral, I would also like to have more restaurants in my neighborhood where I can just hang out, have a good time with my friends, and obviously in our neighborhoods. Light, Medipan, Light, Hyperks, and Presidore Chester, those are hard to come by. And we know that it's been really difficult, and as Councilor Arral stated, now Congressman I honestly really love the charge here, and there's still a lot more work to do. \nSPEAKER_07:  to get local licenses into our neighborhoods. Obviously, that's hard when we have to go to the state each time. \nSPEAKER_07:  I've been following on the work that we did last week trying to get restricted liquor licenses. \nSPEAKER_07:  along with my close-bond sir, Councillor Mejia. \nSPEAKER_07:  in Roxbury. This is continuing part of that same dialogue. I think Councillor Warhol is creativity on ways that we can address that for our entrepreneurs and our startup restaurants and businesses and to think creatively about how we can automate. \nSPEAKER_07:  automate having an increase in these licenses in the future. So thank you for your leadership and I look forward to working with you on this. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Councillor Jean. The Chair recognizes Councillor. \nSPEAKER_10:  A royal council royal. \nSPEAKER_05:  of the four. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, Councillor Wreland and Councillor Louis-Genn, for moving this forward. As many Councillors know, I don't actually drink, but I recognize the competitive disadvantage that restaurants without liquor licenses find themselves at in the city when it comes to surviving as a business in the city. We know that there's also a difference in the quality of food at restaurants that have liquor licenses in terms of the ability to offer sit-down services as opposed to takeout services and when they did a study at the Boston Public Health Commission on sort of the butterfly effect of things like this, what ended up being found was due to the lack of liquor licenses and some unapace-like matterpan, what actually that cascaded towards was a lack of sit-down restaurants and that led to a lack of food options and healthy food options for residents which then led to health impacts on our communities. And so many of these things that may not seem to have any sort of intersectionality with other really important aspects of quality of life in our neighbourhoods do. And so there's a competitive reason to do this, there's a smart, small business keeping dollars local reason to do this and there's also distinct health impacts and benefits of doing something like this in neighbourhoods that have not seen the kind of \nSPEAKER_05:  liquor license access like Hy Park, like Madapen, like Dorchester that other places, specifically downtown, and other places have seen. And, you know, \nSPEAKER_05:  This is something that I hope we continue to do. I hope that there's an automated way to continue to increase those numbers because frankly the liquor license process is a little arcane and I don't really believe beneficial to business in the city period. Other cities that have different liquor license processes have healthier restaurant industries, have healthier bar industries, have healthier sort of hospitality industries and I think you know ultimately this is something that has been a fight for the council for a very, very, very, very long time. When it comes to liquor licenses and preserving the value of people who have liquor licenses and I do wonder in the future whether or not there's space to look at whether or not we have the ability to sort of purchase out as a city some of these liquor licenses and really move towards \nSPEAKER_05:  creating a brand new process at some point in time, but in the guidelines and in the rubrics and the ways in which we're supposed to do this now, I think this is a good start. So thank you to the Councillors. Thank you, Mr. President. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Council Roya would anyone else like to speak on this matter. \nSPEAKER_10:  Would anyone else like to add their name? Please raise your hand. \nSPEAKER_10:  Mr. Clerk, please add Councillor Bock. \nSPEAKER_10:  Council of Raiden. \nSPEAKER_10:  Council flurry, Council Lara. \nSPEAKER_10:  Councilor McGeeer, Councilor Murphy. \nSPEAKER_10:  Please add the chair. \nSPEAKER_10:  Government. \nSPEAKER_10:  Docket 0465 will be referred to the Committee on Government Operations. Mr. Clerk, please read Docket 0466. \nSPEAKER_10:  \nSPEAKER_09:  I can have a 0, 4, 6, 6, Councilor Arroyo after the following. \nSPEAKER_09:  in ordinance creating a municipal identification card in the city of Boston. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. The chair recognizes. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Council Royal, Council Royal, you have the floor. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Mr. President. I'm very excited to introduce municipal identification or an ordinance to create municipal identification for the city of Boston. This has been a long time coming. There was a study done in 2018, exploring the feasibility of this and what services residents would want, but other major cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago have already successfully done municipal identification programs. The great part about a municipal identification program is it gives Boston residents sort of a one-card fits all situations. So in Chicago, for instance, their municipal residents ID cards allow them to access the MBTA. It serves as what our Charlie cards would serve as. They're venture cards, so their identification actually works as their T card. It also works as their Boston, their Chicago Public Library card. So the goal here is to create a municipal ID that sort of centers city services on one card, but also does things like New York's card, which New York's card gives you benefits to cultural institutions. It gives you sales and discounts to tickets to the museums and to their zoos and to their different city institutions. And so it gives this one sort of resource-rich card access. The wonderful part about municipal identification is that it allows us to be more inclusive in the city and who has IDs. We need IDs for many different things. And some standards for IDs are very difficult for folks who are here with proper documentation or without proper documentation to attain. This would allow folks under a very strenuous list of \nSPEAKER_05:  requirements to preside identification of who they are to the agency that will issue these but also that they live here. This gives the opportunity to create a very inclusive city and to send a message that Boston is a gateway city is a city that is looking to be as inclusive and welcoming to all who call Boston home. And so I am excited to move forward with this. We have very workable examples that now exist in other cities. This is no longer a new idea. This is already sort of started to take root and has been in place for several years and other municipalities. So we are sort of following up on that. But this is something that really should exist and really will go a long way to improving the lives and residents in the city of Boston. So I look forward to introducing this into moving this through. Thank you, Mr. President. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Councilor Royale. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  But anyone else like to speak on this matter? \nSPEAKER_10:  Would anyone else like to add their name, please raise your hand. \nSPEAKER_10:  Mr. Clerk, please add Councillor Bock, Councillor Braden, Councillor Edwards, Councillor Fernandez Anderson, Councillor Flaherty, Councillor Lara, Councillor Lugin, Councillor Mejia. \nSPEAKER_10:  Council Murphy, Council, we're all pleased at the chair. \nSPEAKER_10:  Do I get zero four? \nSPEAKER_10:  sex sex will be referred to. \nSPEAKER_10:  the Committee on Government Operations. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um. \nSPEAKER_10:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_10:  Mr. Clerk, please amend the attendance report to include Council Edwards as present. \nSPEAKER_10:  Mr. Clerk, please. \nSPEAKER_09:  Redock at 0467. \nSPEAKER_09:  Dr. Nambar, 0467. Council is flint and braiding off of the following. \nSPEAKER_09:  in order for a hearing to discuss PES. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  control in the city. \nSPEAKER_05:  of Boston. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Mr. Clerk. The Chair now recognizes Councillor Flynn. Councillor Flynn, you have the floor. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Councilor Royale. May I suspend rule 12 and add Councilor Murphy? \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  as an original subject. \nSPEAKER_05:  sponsor. \nSPEAKER_05:  seeing and hearing no objection, Council Murphy is so added. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Councillor Flandy, you have before. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. Thank you to my \nSPEAKER_10:  colleagues, council Braden and council Murphy, but also all of my colleagues that have been working diligently on \nSPEAKER_10:  pest control related issues. \nSPEAKER_10:  whether it's over the last couple months or over the last several years. \nSPEAKER_10:  This is an issue that \nSPEAKER_10:  I receive \nSPEAKER_10:  I received many calls on each day. \nSPEAKER_10:  throughout my district, south Boston, the south end. \nSPEAKER_10:  Chinatown, Bay Village in other areas. It's a public health. \nSPEAKER_10:  situation. It's a public safety situation. \nSPEAKER_10:  and it's a quality of life concerned for me and for residents of the city. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um \nSPEAKER_10:  When discussing road and control, we also need to talk about illegal dumping that's happening across our city. \nSPEAKER_10:  but also talking about the proper way to take out it. \nSPEAKER_10:  trash barrel. \nSPEAKER_10:  And part of that has to be an educational component to residents on the effect of, in proper way, of taking out a barrel and how to store it and how to clean it. It seems simple, but these quality life issues are critical. \nSPEAKER_10:  It's important that we discuss pest control because it's literally impacting every neighborhood across the city. \nSPEAKER_10:  And I'm going to... \nSPEAKER_10:  Hopefully work with my colleagues in advocating for more funding during \nSPEAKER_10:  during the budget process to address this critical issue. So again, I want to say thank you to all of my colleagues to Mayor Wilkin, her team, have been on several walk-arounds and various neighborhoods with public works, with \nSPEAKER_10:  Code enforcement, with inspectional services, especially in the south end. \nSPEAKER_10:  about this issue. So again, I want to say thank you to the dedicated city \nSPEAKER_10:  employees that work on this issue, but they need more support from us as well. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Councillor Wright. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Councillor Flynn. \nSPEAKER_05:  The Chair now recognizes Councillor Brayden, Councillor Brayden, floor is yours. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you to President Flynn for \nSPEAKER_04:  Ynt yn trustair Those subsequent, fe eich hyn car \nSPEAKER_04:  pest control and pest and road and infestations are certainly a big issue all across our city. \nSPEAKER_04:  Dr\u3053\u3061\u3089 wedi shoe lwyf\u7d69 digaill iallfa to it yn gael yn recafil ystyrraur. \nSPEAKER_04:  Blaenau'n rhan oedd falddau bydgan cyf \uad1c\ucc2e\uc544xi o fsa'i ddiwbius honor oedd gall arau caelu i ni\u03bd oedd os ywostan ym \u00e2 roedau poeirau eu creu. \nSPEAKER_04:  and with the vast influx of development occurring in the neighbourhood, we are seeing many, many more complaints from \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  from residents about increased \nSPEAKER_04:  presence of rodents in our yards and in our \nSPEAKER_04:  in our streets and in our restaurants, not in our restaurants, but around our \nSPEAKER_04:  outdoor dining facilities and in our restaurants. \nSPEAKER_04:  We also have a huge number of absentee landlords, many of whom are not, do not provide adequate \nSPEAKER_04:  as trash receptacles and do not keep their premises clean and tidy to prevent rat infestation. \nSPEAKER_04:  The other concern we have is we just heard in recent hearing that we're no longer going to be able to put mattresses into \nSPEAKER_04:  into \nSPEAKER_04:  und trisch stay putte mal den trisch stay \nSPEAKER_04:  da neu'r g \uac10 \u3044cr bryd\u0441\u0442\u0432 \u00e2 gweld i terws\u00e2m staat un gwaith Austral yn anaedr anardwys lasau a trafor a pefle pith\u97f3enteurEM reloos AS Bgebwerll cat ymu i'w goli un rydyn ni'n edryd a phir mechanicol a mael efoyd yn yr\ufffdised espotol ylfed \u0446\u0435 an limitingbet. \nSPEAKER_04:  rat infestations across our city. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I look forward to the conversation. I hope that \nSPEAKER_04:  This is a perennial conversation. I think we've been talking about this for years, but I hope that \nSPEAKER_04:  We can continue to push for our \nSPEAKER_04:  add more adequate funding to help address these issues. \nSPEAKER_04:  and also \nSPEAKER_04:  to see if we can innovate and come up with good solutions. This is not just a problem with the rodents themselves, but also with human behaviors and how we dispose. \nSPEAKER_04:  How we live in a urban setting and try and \nSPEAKER_04:  try and limit the opportunities for \nSPEAKER_04:  Rotten infestations. It's not a rocket science. \nSPEAKER_04:  ac werden bryd yn nedeg matertu \nSPEAKER_04:  And if we can educate our residents about appropriate trash disposal, etc. Hopefully we can. \nSPEAKER_04:  ond slyyd mudd i hwn wneud kon Clado fel Lucienaeth, Dr this a relion roethyw yn est saltycat yn y prynau Welsh. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you Councillor Braden. Chair now recognizes Councillor Murphy. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  So many neighborhoods across the city we know have a road and problem. I've had one for years on my street. So I'm happy to join President Flan and Council of Lebride and to tackle this issue. \nSPEAKER_01:  like consul if \nSPEAKER_01:  Flynn said this is a quality of life and a public health issue and my office gets calls and emails all the time not just from Austin Brighton which I know most of the calls do come from but from neighborhoods across you know every neighborhood in the city so I look forward to the work ahead. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Councillor Murphy. But anyone else likes to speak on this matter? See Councillor McKee at the floor, yours. \nSPEAKER_11:  Yeah. Thank you to the makers. Really excited to have this conversation. Just want to point out a few things. One, in terms of accountability, we also need to lean into \nSPEAKER_11:  Developers, right, in terms of how they do business here in the City of Boston because when development happens in our city \nSPEAKER_11:  Um. \nSPEAKER_11:  We see a high influx of rotons. And I think that that's something that we need to lean into in terms of \nSPEAKER_11:  It needs to be on that target list and then I also want to uplift landlords, right? Landlords also have a role to play in this, so I think that it's great that we are including them. And then it's also important for us as a city to look at BHA. \nSPEAKER_11:  and management companies. There are a lot of folks, the CDC's that get money to \nSPEAKER_11:  support and be property managers, but I get calls all the time from parents and families who are dodging literally rats every single day and you know don't see themselves really being heard so I think that in terms of accountability we need to ensure that we're bringing the management companies into these conversations because they also have a role to play in how we deal with this situation and I think you know I always think back about \nSPEAKER_11:  During remote learning, there were a lot of young people who were afraid to turn on their cameras. \nSPEAKER_11:  because they were afraid. \nSPEAKER_11:  that they're \nSPEAKER_11:  their classmates would see Ruins, Kakarotches and mice. \nSPEAKER_11:  Um, \nSPEAKER_11:  pass them across the screen and I think that that speaks volumes to the social emotional impact that this is also making on our students. So I just wanted to lift that up. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Councillor Mejia. Councillor Lara, the floor is yours. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, Chair. I just wanted to thank President Flynn and the other co-sponsors. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think this is a unique opportunity for us to collaborate with other neighboring cities. I think as Councillor Brayden mentioned, this is an issue that is a regional issue. City Councillor at large from Somerville Charlotte Kelly, famously ran her campaign with a rat plan for Somerville. \nSPEAKER_02:  and some of you will have a free \nSPEAKER_02:  PES Control Assistance Program that they run, that they offer to homeowners, and so there's a lot of, there's opportunity for us to innovate, and there's also a lot of best practices that are already available. \nSPEAKER_02:  put in place by our counterparts in surrounding cities. And so my hope is that we can invite them to talk about what they've implemented and how we can recreate some of that here in the city of Boston as well. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Councillor. \nSPEAKER_05:  Chair and I recognize this Councillor Flaherty. \nSPEAKER_05:  Councillor Flaud in the floor is yours. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you Mr. Chair. Please add my name and just through the maker, just to suggest in that. \nSPEAKER_08:  We bring obviously ISD and maybe the fire department. The solution to this issue is dry ice. \nSPEAKER_08:  The problem is apparently someone has patented and it does called rat ice. \nSPEAKER_08:  So it now requires our road and control division when they want to administer this, which is the safest and most humane way to address the issue. \nSPEAKER_08:  They have to get in the vehicle, drive up to a woovern. \nSPEAKER_08:  and get what's called a label, which is basically a permit. \nSPEAKER_08:  and then have to turn around and then go down to Rockland. \nSPEAKER_08:  and pick up the dry ice. \nSPEAKER_08:  and then come back to the City of Boston. Colossal waste of time. \nSPEAKER_08:  So we need to figure out a way through ISD, maybe our fire department, maybe the council through ordinance. \nSPEAKER_08:  to allow the expectual service department. \nSPEAKER_08:  to get dry ice. \nSPEAKER_08:  right over at the new market area, which is where they used to get it before someone got cute. \nSPEAKER_08:  or what would have turned me on to put on it and they have now patented which now prevents municipalities like Boston to be able to utilize a very \nSPEAKER_08:  useful tool to combat. \nSPEAKER_08:  road infestation and for those who know anything about the Norwegian Ratt and how they migrate and how they repopulate all of that stuff, reproduce. \nSPEAKER_08:  You know that the baiting and the traps only go so far, but also when you have experts in here which we've had Experts in this chamber. They talk about \nSPEAKER_08:  They've almost become immune to some of the... \nSPEAKER_08:  the pesticides, the bait that we're using. In fact, they built up such a tolerance that, you know, in the old days, you would only take a little bait would work. Now, you literally have to put \nSPEAKER_08:  a basic pound of bait. \nSPEAKER_08:  to be able to sort of just to be able to maintain \nSPEAKER_08:  some sense of catching up. \nSPEAKER_08:  Dry ice eliminates all that. And so you think about the rats that have borrowed in the common, and all of our parks or around our BHA developments, walk along the BHA developments when you take tours in your district and see all the rat holes alongside the building. \nSPEAKER_08:  Dry ice will solve that problem almost instantaneously. So again, through the maker, if you could make sure that we get ISD, maybe the fight upon it. \nSPEAKER_08:  Maybe even state regulators, because there's a solution to this problem. \nSPEAKER_08:  It's very simple, it's dry ice. However, our hands are tied. \nSPEAKER_08:  because someone has patented his regulations that will be seen. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you, Mr. Chair. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you Councillor Flourity. The Chair recognizes Councillor Flynn. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Councilor Royo, and I certainly agree with my colleague, Councilor Flarety. \nSPEAKER_10:  We will have that discussion here. \nSPEAKER_10:  both dry ice. We will have the appropriate city agencies and that is our plan is to try to \nSPEAKER_10:  come up with a solution where we have easy access. City officials have easy access to dry ice. That's a huge, that's a huge \nSPEAKER_10:  Asset for us in dealing with \nSPEAKER_10:  dealing with this issue. I was in the south end. \nSPEAKER_10:  in one of the public hours last two weeks ago. \nSPEAKER_10:  and the amount of rodents and rats in that area, the only way they could kill them is through dry ice. \nSPEAKER_10:  But the other aspect I feel to mention that I want to mention now since the opportunity, the city is coming up with the composting city wide. \nSPEAKER_10:  So we also want to make sure that when the City of Boston comes out with a composting plan. \nSPEAKER_10:  that there's a huge educational aspect to it. \nSPEAKER_10:  It's not as simple as just disposing of the food waste. There's a process to it that residents need to be educated. The other aspect is \nSPEAKER_10:  We also need to educate our residents that don't speak English. And we have to have a campaign around the city in various languages so that we can educate people in different languages about this quality of life, this public health. I call it emergency really. \nSPEAKER_10:  So thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you to Councilor Flarety. And when we do have this committee hearing, \nSPEAKER_10:  Um \nSPEAKER_10:  My goal was to keep it in. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um \nSPEAKER_10:  Keep it open. \nSPEAKER_10:  so that we can meet on it every month or so with various experts. Continue to learn about it and continue to make progress on it. \nSPEAKER_10:  I had the opportunity to talk to the City of Newton last month. \nSPEAKER_10:  The City of New York has an excellent. \nSPEAKER_10:  Road in test control program. \nSPEAKER_10:  But a lot of good cities are doing great work on this issue. It's also about working together. So again, I want to say thank you to my colleagues for their interest and they work on this issue for a long period of time. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Mr. Joe. Thank you, Councillor Flynn. Chair recognizes Councillor Bach. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just wanted to dovetail on that to say that as the Chair of City Services. \nSPEAKER_00:  I very much think this is like the \nSPEAKER_00:  It is like the ultimate in like basic city services and like what does it mean to have a clean and sanitary city And so definitely look forward to working with the president and the co-sponsors around both holding that hearing and As he suggested keeping it open making sure that that's an ongoing conversation throughout the term for self \nSPEAKER_00:  Looking forward to it. Thank you, Mr. Chair. \nSPEAKER_05:  looking forward to it. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you Councillor Bach. Would anyone else like to add their name? \nSPEAKER_05:  God. \nSPEAKER_05:  Please add Councillor Bock, Councillor Edwards, Councillor Fernandez Anderson, Councillor Flarety, Councillor Lara, Councillor Lulligenne, Councillor Mejia, Councillor Morelle, please add my name. \nSPEAKER_05:  Alright. \nSPEAKER_05:  seeing no further. \nSPEAKER_05:  Docket 0467 will be assigned to the Committee on City Services and Innovation Technology. Thank you, Mr. Clerk. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Council Roy O. \nSPEAKER_10:  Mr. Clerk, please read, document. \nSPEAKER_09:  at zero four. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  success. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Document number 0468, Councilor Mejia, off of the following. \nSPEAKER_09:  in order for a hearing on establishing a mental health \nSPEAKER_09:  curriculum in Boston Public Schools. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  that she recognizes Councilman here, Councilman here. \nSPEAKER_10:  You have the floor. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you, Mr. President, and I would like to add my colleague, Councillor Erick Murphy. \nSPEAKER_11:  as a cold sponsor in the searing order? \nSPEAKER_10:  Council Murphy is so added. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  Since even before the COVID-19 pandemic, we've been dealing with a pandemic in our Boston Public Schools around mental health. \nSPEAKER_11:  and wellness. It's gotten so bad that the American Academy \nSPEAKER_11:  of pediatric's \nSPEAKER_11:  and adolescent psychiatry and children's hospital association have declared a national emergency and children's mental health, citing a serious toll \nSPEAKER_11:  of the COVID-19 pandemic on top of existing challenges. \nSPEAKER_11:  Every day students are being asked to leave their backpacks full of trauma at the door. \nSPEAKER_11:  so that they can focus on their studies. \nSPEAKER_11:  And recently we have seen how that untreated trauma has spilled. \nSPEAKER_11:  I'm over in our schools out into these streets. From the shooting outside of Tech Boston Academy to the loaded gun found at young achievers of science and math and school, to several tombstones of our last year. \nSPEAKER_11:  And you loved ones being defaced and even stolen. \nSPEAKER_11:  It is clear that we need to be doing a lot more to address mental health and wellness in our schools. In school, we teach students how to read, how to write, how to run, and even how to eat. \nSPEAKER_11:  But we do not do. \nSPEAKER_11:  What we do not do is give them the tools and resources to unpack their trauma in a non-violent and productive way. \nSPEAKER_11:  This is why we're filing this hearing order. \nSPEAKER_11:  In terms of the data, the numbers are pretty clear. According to the federal Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, emergency department's visits for suspected suicide attempts among adolescents jumped \nSPEAKER_11:  31% \nSPEAKER_11:  in 2020 compared to 2019. \nSPEAKER_11:  In February and March of this year, emergency department visits for suspected \nSPEAKER_11:  on suicide attempts were \nSPEAKER_11:  51% higher among girls. \nSPEAKER_11:  ages 12 to 17. \nSPEAKER_11:  during the same period. \nSPEAKER_11:  in 2019. \nSPEAKER_11:  I get choked up because I have a 12 year old daughter. So this is hard. \nSPEAKER_11:  Um \nSPEAKER_11:  And I'm also having my own experience with this issue. So I'm growing up, you already know my story. \nSPEAKER_11:  So this clearly indicates that we need to be moving beyond the conventional plans of providing school, psychologists, and social workers when needed. \nSPEAKER_11:  They do great work, but we need to be doing more. \nSPEAKER_11:  in California, a bill which recently passed requires each school district, county office of education, state specials, and \nSPEAKER_11:  School and charter school that offers one or more courses in health education to pupils in middle school or high school to include those courses, some form of instructional mental health. \nSPEAKER_11:  And way back in 1999 Massachusetts Commissioner of Education David Driscoh released a comprehensive health curriculum framework. \nSPEAKER_11:  which seeks to introduce mental health into the classroom. \nSPEAKER_11:  But it's clear that we're not doing enough or being intentional around mental health education in our schools. \nSPEAKER_11:  So I'm hoping to use this hearing as an opportunity to look at what more we can be doing to uplift mental health and wellness in our schools. \nSPEAKER_11:  and before I finish. \nSPEAKER_11:  I also just want to give a shout out to Councillor Murphy, who has made youth mental health a cornerstone of her office's work. \nSPEAKER_11:  And I'm hoping that as the Chair and Vice Chair of the Committee of Education, we will be able to work collaboratively on this issue together. \nSPEAKER_11:  Our success as legislators is measured by the quality of the world we leave behind for the next generation and we need to ensure that we have all the resources \nSPEAKER_11:  and they need to be set up for success. \nSPEAKER_11:  you \nSPEAKER_11:  And that very much includes mental health and wellness. Thank you. And I just wanted to say really quickly, because you know me, I always got a riff. \nSPEAKER_11:  off the top. \nSPEAKER_11:  I'll speak from my heart because that's just the way. \nSPEAKER_11: \u0e17\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19\u0e19\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07 \nSPEAKER_11:  Um \nSPEAKER_11:  You know, we have as parents oftentimes passed on our own trauma to our children because we weren't taught how to deal with it. \nSPEAKER_11:  You know, I talk about the fact that when I was a teen, I also attempted suicide, but my mom was so afraid. \nSPEAKER_11:  that I would be taken away from her that she never did anything about it. And I grew up believing that she didn't love me. \nSPEAKER_11:  And I think that if we're tackling mental health, we have an opportunity to destigmatize it. \nSPEAKER_11:  in a way \nSPEAKER_11:  that will help our \nSPEAKER_11:  The little ones understand that it's okay not to be okay. \nSPEAKER_11:  Um \nSPEAKER_11:  and that they need to be able to seek the support services that they need. And I think that this conversation is not just about \nSPEAKER_11:  a moment of \nSPEAKER_11:  of \nSPEAKER_11:  political theater, it really is looking at the violence that's spilling over into our streets. There is a deep connection. \nSPEAKER_11:  here. \nSPEAKER_11:  and we need to center mental health and wellness as part of that conversation. Otherwise, we're not getting to the root. \nSPEAKER_11:  So my hope is that as we continue to lean into this conversation, we recognize the responsibility and the opportunity that we have. \nSPEAKER_11:  to change doing business as usual. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Councilman here. \nSPEAKER_10:  The chair recognizes councilor Murphy, councilor Murphy, you have the floor. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  So we know our children are suffering with mental health issues and we cannot expect them to properly address their stress and mental health struggles if you don't teach them the tools they need to work through this. \nSPEAKER_01:  Teaching mental health will lead to better outcomes for our children. \nSPEAKER_01:  I know council mahea has mentioned some of them, but we know the statistics are scary. Suicide is the third leading cause of death for children ages 10 to 24. \nSPEAKER_01:  in many or most of mental health conditions start during adolescence. \nSPEAKER_01:  Knowledge is power, so I thank Councilor Mijia for being the lead sponsor on this important issue. And I look forward to working with her and my other colleagues to make sure that this happens for our students in the Boston Public Schools and across the city. So thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Council Murphy. \nSPEAKER_10:  The chair recognizes Councillor Fernandez-Anneson, Councillor Fernandez-Anneson, you have the floor. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you, Mr. President. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Councilor Mejia for your courage to \nSPEAKER_03:  open up to such a vulnerable state with us. \nSPEAKER_03:  and to be so beautiful and so pure. \nSPEAKER_03:  to be able to share yourself with us in a way that \nSPEAKER_03:  Uh \nSPEAKER_03:  really \nSPEAKER_03:  exemplifies what a leader should \nSPEAKER_03:  conduct to herself as and I really appreciate you know the way you took us through that and \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm just humbled to hear you, to be able to have so much courage, to be that vulnerable with us because a lot of us speak about mental health and it's become a political jargon that \nSPEAKER_03:  I think everyone now it's a catchphrase that we know \nSPEAKER_03:  that we all must support, that we all to an issue, to an issue, to an issue. So we all talk about it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  the way that I've seen yourself in Constra Murphy. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  guide us through this or at least the way I've watched you do it, I really appreciate you for that. In terms of what you file today, \nSPEAKER_03:  I really look forward to the work. I would love to, please add, my name is Mr. President. I would love to work with you on it. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think that one of the issues is not just, you know, the problem is not adding one social worker for school or \nSPEAKER_03:  as you say, bringing the homeschool connection or creating that platform. \nSPEAKER_03:  The CBHI, CBHI, so children behavior health initiative for through mass health. \nSPEAKER_03:  covers only medical necessities. So this means that the service, the clinician will then go in and \nSPEAKER_03:  have to diagnose in order for the service to be rendered. The issue with that is fee for service and perpetuates the cyclical effect of \nSPEAKER_03:  prison pipeline because you have to diagnose \nSPEAKER_03:  or sometimes misdiagnose or harshly diagnosed a child. So I question and I really want us to talk about how are we diagnosing our black and brown children and how many \nSPEAKER_03:  How many fees do you have to take in order to render that service? Sometimes the issues are as you are putting it in your here, in your \nSPEAKER_03:  request for the hearing. \nSPEAKER_03:  in the order is that \nSPEAKER_03:  You sometimes, the issue is circumstantial. It's situational. So it deserves a temporary NOS just to get that three-month service, to figure out why that kid is in the shelter, or why that kid's acting up, or why what's the problem circumstantially, temporarily for that moment? \nSPEAKER_03:  But what happens is once they get the diagnosis, it follows them throughout their lives, and then they end up going, you know, not getting a job or not or whatever. You know how to cooky crumbles. \nSPEAKER_03:  But I can't say enough how passionate I am about it. \nSPEAKER_03:  I am a strong advocate and I look forward to the work with you. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Council, Fernandez Anderson and Mr. Clerk, please add, Council, Fernandez Anderson. \nSPEAKER_10:  Her name would anyone else like to speak on this matter? \nSPEAKER_10:  with anyone else like to it. \nSPEAKER_10:  A te emang, shall we go to the saker? \nSPEAKER_10:  Councillor Aroyo, Councillor Boehre, Councillor Braden, Councillor Edwards. \nSPEAKER_10:  Council for Nandison, Council Flarey, Council Vara, Council Lujen. \nSPEAKER_10:  Councilor Rowan, please add the chair. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um \nSPEAKER_10:  Darker 0468 will be referred to the committee on education. \nSPEAKER_10:  Mr. Clerk, please readdoctor 0469. \nSPEAKER_10:  \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Dock number 0469, Councillors, Whirl and Mehea, offer the following. Order for a hearing regarding barriers to business. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  that she recognizes council. \nSPEAKER_06:  Council we're all. \nSPEAKER_06:  You have the floor. Thank you, President Plain, and thank you to my co-sponsor, Councilor Mejia, for her work around small businesses here in the city. The Institute of Justice recently released a report called Bariast Business to study how regulatory burdens impact entrepreneurs across 20 cities, including Boston. \nSPEAKER_06:  The report documents that fees range from $945 to $554 to start a restaurant. \nSPEAKER_06:  The report scores Boston 1 out of 5 in a one-stop shop analysis reporting that the city's website does not effectively centralize information for entrepreneurs in an intuitive and organized way. The report also reveals the extremely complex process for starting a business stating restaurants must complete 92 steps and barbershops 81 steps. There are also additional areas in Boston and it's something that Councillor Anderson always brings up is the clean hands requirement that means applicants for permits or licenses can be denied even if they owe a small amount of fines or fees to the city. \nSPEAKER_06:  These burdensome requirements, especially impact low income, MWBE, entrepreneurs, that we need to do everything possible to streamline processes and explore costs associated with starting a business. We must do better to ensure that we support small business growth to allow our main streets to flourish and contribute to our city. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Councilor Laurel. \nSPEAKER_10:  Be. \nSPEAKER_10:  Chair recognizes Councilor Meher. Councilor Meher, you have the floor. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you to Councilor Rural for adding us as one of the original co-sponsors. As the former chair of the Committee of Small Business, I'm really excited that you are now taking the lead on this and so incredibly grateful for your leadership and the space. \nSPEAKER_11:  Um, \nSPEAKER_11:  you know during my time. \nSPEAKER_11:  And as the committee chair, we were doing so during the hardest. \nSPEAKER_11:  point here in the city of Boston with the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_11:  And I saw firsthand how the barriers to businesses negatively impact communities of color. \nSPEAKER_11:  both for people who are \nSPEAKER_11:  established business owners and for those who are looking to start their own business. We worked. \nSPEAKER_11:  to try to eliminate these barriers to business ownership, including passing the language access, ordinance, and as well as establishing the retail residential kitchens, ordinance here in the city of Boston. But we know that there's not one policy that can be implemented that's going to lift the decades of policy decisions that have been contributing to the equities that we are seeing today. \nSPEAKER_11:  as retail spaces become more expensive, as you know. \nSPEAKER_11:  can't even afford. \nSPEAKER_11:  a bathroom. \nSPEAKER_11:  these days to set up shop because everything is so expensive in the city no matter who you are. \nSPEAKER_11:  I think that the process of obtaining licenses remain as confusing as ever. \nSPEAKER_11:  And we need to act to ensure that our city is a model for entrepreneurs and small businesses. And I look forward to this hearing and to working alongside Councillor Warau and the whole council are reducing these barriers to businesses. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Councilman here. Would anyone else like to speak on this matter? \nSPEAKER_10:  Would anyone else like to... \nSPEAKER_10:  Sponsored, please raise your hand. \nSPEAKER_10:  Mr. Clerk, please add Councillor Eroio, Councillor Bock, Councillor Braden, Councillor Edwards, Councillor Fernandez-Nicson, Councillor Flarete, Councillor Lara, Councillor Luj\u00e1n. \nSPEAKER_10:  Councilor Murphy and please add the chair. \nSPEAKER_10:  Dr. Zero, four, six nine will be referred to the Committee on Small Business and Professional License. \nSPEAKER_10:  We're on to personnel orders.

The chair recognizes Councillor Royo, chair of the Committee on Government Operations, Councillor Royo. \nSPEAKER_05:  of the floor. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Mr. Chair. The committee on government operations, how the working session on Monday, April 4th, on Docket 0321 petition for a special law regarding securing environmental justice in the City of Boston, which was sponsored by Councillor Liddy Edwards. I'd like to thank my council colleagues for attending, Councillor Flynn, Councillor Lara, Councillor Mejia, Councillor Murphy, Councillor Flarety, Councillor Bock, and Councillor Wereld. \nSPEAKER_05:  This home role petition would declare that a state of emergency exists in the city of Boston with regards to environmental injustice and climate change. \nSPEAKER_05:  If passed, this legislation would amend the BPDAs enabling action to remove public services corporations' ability to seek an exemption to all Boston's own laws by petitioning the State Department of Public Utilities. Instead, this legislation will give the Building Commission or the authority to enforce environmental justice standards if the Commissioner determines that a use or proposed use of a building structure or land in the city would negatively impact environmental rights afforded to residents by state law. The Building Commissioner would have the authority to issue a stock work order or suspend any issued permits, licenses, or authorizations. Associated with the use or proposed use at the working session, the Committee heard from several environmental justice advocates about the urgency of securing environmental justice in Boston. \nSPEAKER_05:  and protecting local communities, the utility company representative stated that they believe that existing state regulations provided sufficient environmental justice protections. The sponsor clarified that the legislation \nSPEAKER_05:  would grant extra authority to the Building Commissioner. \nSPEAKER_05:  And that more specific building standards can be crafted by the zoning commission and the building commissioner of the state passes this. There was a suggestion or language be added specifying that the process of deciding those building standards shall be guided by the needs of community through a civic engagement process. So while we wait to receive specific language amendments that were discussed at the working session, we're recommending that this remains in committee. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Mr. Consul. Royal. Wouldn't any of our colleagues like to speak in this matter? \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you Ms. Collins. \nSPEAKER_10:  Do I get zero, three, two, one? \nSPEAKER_10:  We'll remain in committee.

As someone who led the efforts on this body to help get CPA passed along with some of my colleagues \nSPEAKER_08:  and many, many constituents and advocates in voters across the city. This hearing is my favorite hearing each year. It's the opportunity for us to see \nSPEAKER_08:  a great program evolved. \nSPEAKER_08:  I continue to grow and you see more folks get excited about it. I think you referenced it last night and after you had left other folks that spoke, I'd reference your comments about talking about something that just brings people and brings communities together. It's the CPA as I believe in vision. With that said, we heard following testimony from Marien Garso, we heard from Chief Dylan, Deputy Director Jessica Boatwright, Chief Mary M.

Can we do better, always, we can always. \nSPEAKER_08:  If any program in the city is working and is reaching out as best they can, it's this group and they'll continue to do so as referenced by our colleagues' questions last night. The breakdown is as follows, 27 million in change will go 14,660,159 dollars will go to affordable housing projects, 6,141,357 dollars will go to historic preservation projects, 6,400,338 in recreational use and open space projects. So to date, that over 92 million has been awarded to 198 projects spanning across the city. \nSPEAKER_08:  with the approval of this appropriation. \nSPEAKER_08:  will be awarding $119 million over to 250 projects since the funding. \nSPEAKER_08:  begin in 2018. So during the course of the hearing we had robust public testimony in favor of the of the proposed project, of all of them very deserving including testimony from some of our youngest residents in the city advocating for projects that impacted their school, their community, and others. As chair of the committee, I'd like this manager, a remaining committee just to allow for some further public comment given that the hearing went late. \nSPEAKER_08:  and we want to make sure that folks that want the opportunity to advocate on behalf of \nSPEAKER_08:  These three buckets of affordable housing, historic preservation and open space have the opportunity to do so. In which case I look forward to putting a committee put together for this party to consider to vote on next Wednesday. If any of my other colleagues through the chair would like to speak, they're happy to accommodate that and we'll have this thing turn around by next Wednesday. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you, Mr. President. \nSPEAKER_10:  and \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Councilor Fliherty. \nSPEAKER_10:  Any of our colleagues like to speak on this matter? \nSPEAKER_10:  I just want to say thank you to Councillor Flaherty and Councillor Bock. \nSPEAKER_10:  Central staff, the mayor's office that was here last night. \nSPEAKER_10:  working late. \nSPEAKER_10:  We appreciate everything. \nSPEAKER_10:  and you'll lead a ship on this important show. \nSPEAKER_10:  as Councillor Flarelli highlighted the Community Preservation Act. \nSPEAKER_10:  is an opportunity for neighbors to come together. \nSPEAKER_10:  Work with City officials. \nSPEAKER_10:  We're in about city government and also improve. \nSPEAKER_10:  quality of life of the enabled, so it's a tremendous program. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Council.

You have the floor. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you, Mr. President. The chair, the Committee on Ways and Means held a hearing to explore a prospect of \nSPEAKER_03:  opportunities for \nSPEAKER_03:  more housing or creating more affordable housing. \nSPEAKER_03:  by way of bonds and we \nSPEAKER_03:  I'd like to thank the administration. I'd like to thank the \nSPEAKER_03:  my lead, the lead co-sponsor or the lead sponsor and my lead and my co-sponsor. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm \nSPEAKER_03:  on this hearing and \nSPEAKER_03:  It will remain in basically will remain committee and we just basically had a robust conversation about the possibilities, administration broke down what bonds was. \nSPEAKER_03:  They gave us a lot of back and forth, not back and forth, but explanations as to \nSPEAKER_03:  what the risks are and in terms of \nSPEAKER_03:  what the possibilities are. They say they would go back to us with projections of what those numbers actually look like. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't know if my \nSPEAKER_03:  co-sponsors like to say anything else about it, but I think that \nSPEAKER_03:  we definitely saw a possibility of exploring bonds and will \nSPEAKER_03:  be happy to report more as we go. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Councilor Fernandez-Anneson. \nSPEAKER_10:  Would any of our colleagues like to speak on this matter? \nSPEAKER_10:  that she recognizes Councillor Luzgeon. \nSPEAKER_10:  You have the floor? \nSPEAKER_07:  conversation yesterday around bonds. I want to thank the administration. \nSPEAKER_07:  I just stare at Maureen Garso and Jim Lewis and Williamson. We came and we talked about bonds. We talked about our general debt policy, but also about what would it look like to increase our debt service or to actually change our repayment schedule so that our bond repayments are a smaller fraction of our overall budget, which gives flexibility to do a lot more. We obviously have been as a city always touting this triple A bond raising, which a lot of us are very proud of the city, but a lot of that is built on a strong economy that is often entrenched in equities in our city. And so exploring ways in which we can actually \nSPEAKER_07:  Ah. \nSPEAKER_07:  attack these issues like affordable housing, like community investments, like more infrastructure in neighborhoods that have been forgotten and excluded and leading into our fiscal strength. \nSPEAKER_07:  through our bond policy is one way to do that. So I want to thank. \nSPEAKER_07:  Everyone who participated in that conversation, you, President Flynn, Councilor Mahia. \nSPEAKER_07:  and we're out. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um \nSPEAKER_07:  Obviously my co-sponsors Councillor Bach and Councillor Fernandes and Anderson both of whom have presented really great ideas around housing and how we can use combined our city's fiscal strength with whether it's what we need to do under the Faircloth Amendment to get more social housing bills or rental home options. I think this really does present us with a really great opportunity to pay for and do the things that we need to do in community to address the urgency of the crises that we're facing here to the city. So it's just the beginning of a conversation and I think the chair holding it and everyone who leaned into it because I know we can seem pretty dry like bond policy but it is really important. It's how we pay for a lot of things that we need to get done so I appreciate the scaring and look forward to further conversations. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Councilor John. \nSPEAKER_07:  Oh, and also just want to thank Councillor former City Councilor Josh Seikham and Professor Ben Bradmo who \nSPEAKER_07:  came and provided really great testimony. And really, I think did a great job of \nSPEAKER_07:  of centering the urgency of the issues we face and how our bond policy can be a tool here. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Councilor John. The Chair recognizes Councillor Bock. Councillor Bock, you're up the floor. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you so much, Mr. President, and thank you also to my co-sponsors, Councillor Fernandez Anderson and Councillor Louie Jenner, the lead sponsor. This was a great hearing to have. I want to summarize it because they put them so. \nSPEAKER_00:  So well, but it's just exciting to me. You know, the last time we were having a version of this conversation, it was last term. \nSPEAKER_00:  The mayor was a co-sponsor on that and so I think that you know talking to our ANF team and seeing the kind of desire and willingness and the council to really bond for housing in a new and robust way. I think like the stars are aligning I hope for us to really talk about that at scale in Boston and I just want to stress in this forum that you know when you look at the West Coast cities LA San Francisco Portland many of which are in very similar acute housing situations as us each of them in the last five years have put out bonds for a billion dollars on housing \nSPEAKER_00:  And I just think that, you know, in the same way that we talked about bonding for, you know, a billion dollars over 10 years for BPS with the Bill of BPS strategy. I think the time has come to talk about that here. And I think that the reality is that there are ways to adjust our policy and even within our policy some of our efficiencies in getting capital spending to actually happen in ways to kind of make room for that type of serious investment. And so. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, just really grateful to the colleagues for \nSPEAKER_00:  relaunching this conversation and as everyone knows I think we should be in the business of building more public housing in the city and that we can We're authorized by the feds to build another 2500 units. So I hope this is a conversation that we can have aggressively and move forward in the coming months. So thank you, Mr. President. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Council Bob. \nSPEAKER_10:  Anyone else like to speak on this matter? \nSPEAKER_10:  at this time. \nSPEAKER_10:  Dark at 0295 \nSPEAKER_10:  We'll remain in committee. \nSPEAKER_10:  We're going on to... \nSPEAKER_10:  We're going on to motions, orders, and resolutions, Mr. Corrick. \nSPEAKER_10:  Please read our could 0 4 6 5. \n",
                "SPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Dock in the middle for six five counselors were all in Louisiana off of the following petition for a special law relative to enact authorizing additional licenses for the sale of alcoholic beverages to be drunk on the premises and Boston. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. The chair recognizes Councillor Rell. Councillor Rell, you have the floor. I'd like to suspend an ad. \nSPEAKER_06:  Royal to the Docket. \nSPEAKER_10:  Seeing and hearing no objections, Council Royo was added as the original third co-sponsor. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you President Flynn and thank you to my co-sponsors, Councillor Louie Jen and Councillor Royo. I also want to acknowledge the work that Congresswoman Presley has done on liquor licenses here in the city of Boston. Out of the 1,448 liquor licenses in the city, only two restaurants have liquor licenses in Madapen and only six on Blue Her Lav. In this home mood petition we are being intentional by creating. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Lick of licenses for those established restaurants and neighborhoods of Dorchester, Hyde Park, and Maddie Pan. Because we must do more and create equity in liquor licenses. I must submit this home-wool petition. It's a little selfish of me. Because like many of other residents, I too want to be able to eat, watch the game, and enjoy your Don Julio resposado, meat, and my own neighborhood. \nSPEAKER_06:  Lick and license in these areas will help our small locally-owned restaurants reestablish themselves after coming through a negative impact of COVID-19. This is an opportunity for us to use our powers to help create local revenue and local jobs and create a clear pathway to small business owners to recover. \nSPEAKER_06:  Through the creation and capacity-sized liquor licenses, we are a helpful, small restaurant established by an interesting fish machine. \nSPEAKER_06:  generating the revenue to expand and the ability to create more jobs in our neighborhoods. This is why we must make sure we increase all liquor licenses each year. It's about the economic health of all our neighborhoods. I'm looking forward to discussion and on the discussion around what is the correct amount of liquor license needed. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Councilor Wirl. \nSPEAKER_10:  that she recognizes consul of Gen, consul of Gen, you have the floor. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you, Mr. President, and I just want to thank Councilor Arral for introducing this home role petition. It's really important that we do everything we can. Like Councilor Arral, I would also like to have more restaurants in my neighborhood where I can just hang out, have a good time with my friends, and obviously in our neighborhoods. Light, Medipan, Light, Hyperks, and Presidore Chester, those are hard to come by. And we know that it's been really difficult, and as Councilor Arral stated, now Congressman I honestly really love the charge here, and there's still a lot more work to do. \nSPEAKER_07:  to get local licenses into our neighborhoods. Obviously, that's hard when we have to go to the state each time. \nSPEAKER_07:  I've been following on the work that we did last week trying to get restricted liquor licenses. \nSPEAKER_07:  along with my close-bond sir, Councillor Mejia. \nSPEAKER_07:  in Roxbury. This is continuing part of that same dialogue. I think Councillor Warhol is creativity on ways that we can address that for our entrepreneurs and our startup restaurants and businesses and to think creatively about how we can automate. \nSPEAKER_07:  automate having an increase in these licenses in the future. So thank you for your leadership and I look forward to working with you on this. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Councillor Jean. The Chair recognizes Councillor. \nSPEAKER_10:  A royal council royal. \nSPEAKER_05:  of the four. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, Councillor Wreland and Councillor Louis-Genn, for moving this forward. As many Councillors know, I don't actually drink, but I recognize the competitive disadvantage that restaurants without liquor licenses find themselves at in the city when it comes to surviving as a business in the city. We know that there's also a difference in the quality of food at restaurants that have liquor licenses in terms of the ability to offer sit-down services as opposed to takeout services and when they did a study at the Boston Public Health Commission on sort of the butterfly effect of things like this, what ended up being found was due to the lack of liquor licenses and some unapace-like matterpan, what actually that cascaded towards was a lack of sit-down restaurants and that led to a lack of food options and healthy food options for residents which then led to health impacts on our communities. And so many of these things that may not seem to have any sort of intersectionality with other really important aspects of quality of life in our neighbourhoods do. And so there's a competitive reason to do this, there's a smart, small business keeping dollars local reason to do this and there's also distinct health impacts and benefits of doing something like this in neighbourhoods that have not seen the kind of \nSPEAKER_05:  liquor license access like Hy Park, like Madapen, like Dorchester that other places, specifically downtown, and other places have seen. And, you know, \nSPEAKER_05:  This is something that I hope we continue to do. I hope that there's an automated way to continue to increase those numbers because frankly the liquor license process is a little arcane and I don't really believe beneficial to business in the city period. Other cities that have different liquor license processes have healthier restaurant industries, have healthier bar industries, have healthier sort of hospitality industries and I think you know ultimately this is something that has been a fight for the council for a very, very, very, very long time. When it comes to liquor licenses and preserving the value of people who have liquor licenses and I do wonder in the future whether or not there's space to look at whether or not we have the ability to sort of purchase out as a city some of these liquor licenses and really move towards \nSPEAKER_05:  creating a brand new process at some point in time, but in the guidelines and in the rubrics and the ways in which we're supposed to do this now, I think this is a good start. So thank you to the Councillors. Thank you, Mr. President. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Council Roya would anyone else like to speak on this matter. \nSPEAKER_10:  Would anyone else like to add their name? Please raise your hand. \nSPEAKER_10:  Mr. Clerk, please add Councillor Bock. \nSPEAKER_10:  Council of Raiden. \nSPEAKER_10:  Council flurry, Council Lara. \nSPEAKER_10:  Councilor McGeeer, Councilor Murphy. \nSPEAKER_10:  Please add the chair. \nSPEAKER_10:  Government. \nSPEAKER_10:  Docket 0465 will be referred to the Committee on Government Operations.

                "SPEAKER_10:  \nSPEAKER_09:  I can have a 0, 4, 6, 6, Councilor Arroyo after the following. \nSPEAKER_09:  in ordinance creating a municipal identification card in the city of Boston. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. The chair recognizes. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Council Royal, Council Royal, you have the floor. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Mr. President. I'm very excited to introduce municipal identification or an ordinance to create municipal identification for the city of Boston. This has been a long time coming. There was a study done in 2018, exploring the feasibility of this and what services residents would want, but other major cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago have already successfully done municipal identification programs. The great part about a municipal identification program is it gives Boston residents sort of a one-card fits all situations. So in Chicago, for instance, their municipal residents ID cards allow them to access the MBTA. It serves as what our Charlie cards would serve as. They're venture cards, so their identification actually works as their T card. It also works as their Boston, their Chicago Public Library card. So the goal here is to create a municipal ID that sort of centers city services on one card, but also does things like New York's card, which New York's card gives you benefits to cultural institutions. It gives you sales and discounts to tickets to the museums and to their zoos and to their different city institutions. And so it gives this one sort of resource-rich card access. The wonderful part about municipal identification is that it allows us to be more inclusive in the city and who has IDs. We need IDs for many different things. And some standards for IDs are very difficult for folks who are here with proper documentation or without proper documentation to attain. This would allow folks under a very strenuous list of \nSPEAKER_05:  requirements to preside identification of who they are to the agency that will issue these but also that they live here. This gives the opportunity to create a very inclusive city and to send a message that Boston is a gateway city is a city that is looking to be as inclusive and welcoming to all who call Boston home. And so I am excited to move forward with this. We have very workable examples that now exist in other cities. This is no longer a new idea. This is already sort of started to take root and has been in place for several years and other municipalities. So we are sort of following up on that. But this is something that really should exist and really will go a long way to improving the lives and residents in the city of Boston. So I look forward to introducing this into moving this through. Thank you, Mr. President. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Councilor Royale. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  But anyone else like to speak on this matter? \nSPEAKER_10:  Would anyone else like to add their name, please raise your hand. \nSPEAKER_10:  Mr. Clerk, please add Councillor Bock, Councillor Braden, Councillor Edwards, Councillor Fernandez Anderson, Councillor Flaherty, Councillor Lara, Councillor Lugin, Councillor Mejia. \nSPEAKER_10:  Council Murphy, Council, we're all pleased at the chair. \nSPEAKER_10:  Do I get zero four? \nSPEAKER_10:  sex sex will be referred to. \nSPEAKER_10:  the Committee on Government Operations. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um. \nSPEAKER_10:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_10:  Mr. Clerk, please amend the attendance report to include Council Edwards as present. \nSPEAKER_10:  Mr. Clerk, please. \nSPEAKER_09:  Redock at 0467. \n",

Thank you to my \nSPEAKER_10:  colleagues, council Braden and council Murphy, but also all of my colleagues that have been working diligently on \nSPEAKER_10:  pest control related issues. \nSPEAKER_10:  whether it's over the last couple months or over the last several years. \nSPEAKER_10:  This is an issue that \nSPEAKER_10:  I receive \nSPEAKER_10:  I received many calls on each day. \nSPEAKER_10:  throughout my district, south Boston, the south end. \nSPEAKER_10:  Chinatown, Bay Village in other areas. It's a public health. \nSPEAKER_10:  situation. It's a public safety situation. \nSPEAKER_10:  and it's a quality of life concerned for me and for residents of the city. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um \nSPEAKER_10:  When discussing road and control, we also need to talk about illegal dumping that's happening across our city. \nSPEAKER_10:  but also talking about the proper way to take out it. \nSPEAKER_10:  trash barrel. \nSPEAKER_10:  And part of that has to be an educational component to residents on the effect of, in proper way, of taking out a barrel and how to store it and how to clean it. It seems simple, but these quality life issues are critical. \nSPEAKER_10:  It's important that we discuss pest control because it's literally impacting every neighborhood across the city. \nSPEAKER_10:  And I'm going to... \nSPEAKER_10:  Hopefully work with my colleagues in advocating for more funding during \nSPEAKER_10:  during the budget process to address this critical issue. So again, I want to say thank you to all of my colleagues to Mayor Wilkin, her team, have been on several walk-arounds and various neighborhoods with public works, with \nSPEAKER_10:  Code enforcement, with inspectional services, especially in the south end. \nSPEAKER_10:  about this issue. So again, I want to say thank you to the dedicated city \nSPEAKER_10:  employees that work on this issue, but they need more support from us as well. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Councillor Wright. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Councillor Flynn. \nSPEAKER_05:  The Chair now recognizes Councillor Brayden, Councillor Brayden, floor is yours. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you to President Flynn for \nSPEAKER_04:  Ynt yn trustair Those subsequent, fe eich hyn car \nSPEAKER_04:  pest control and pest and road and infestations are certainly a big issue all across our city. \nSPEAKER_04:  Dr\u3053\u3061\u3089 wedi shoe lwyf\u7d69 digaill iallfa to it yn gael yn recafil ystyrraur. \nSPEAKER_04:  Blaenau'n rhan oedd falddau bydgan cyf \uad1c\ucc2e\uc544xi o fsa'i ddiwbius honor oedd gall arau caelu i ni\u03bd oedd os ywostan ym \u00e2 roedau poeirau eu creu. \nSPEAKER_04:  and with the vast influx of development occurring in the neighbourhood, we are seeing many, many more complaints from \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  from residents about increased \nSPEAKER_04:  presence of rodents in our yards and in our \nSPEAKER_04:  in our streets and in our restaurants, not in our restaurants, but around our \nSPEAKER_04:  outdoor dining facilities and in our restaurants. \nSPEAKER_04:  We also have a huge number of absentee landlords, many of whom are not, do not provide adequate \nSPEAKER_04:  as trash receptacles and do not keep their premises clean and tidy to prevent rat infestation. \nSPEAKER_04:  The other concern we have is we just heard in recent hearing that we're no longer going to be able to put mattresses into \nSPEAKER_04:  into \nSPEAKER_04:  und trisch stay putte mal den trisch stay \nSPEAKER_04:  da neu'r g \uac10 \u3044cr bryd\u0441\u0442\u0432 \u00e2 gweld i terws\u00e2m staat un gwaith Austral yn anaedr anardwys lasau a trafor a pefle pith\u97f3enteurEM reloos AS Bgebwerll cat ymu i'w goli un rydyn ni'n edryd a phir mechanicol a mael efoyd yn yr\ufffdised espotol ylfed \u0446\u0435 an limitingbet. \nSPEAKER_04:  rat infestations across our city. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I look forward to the conversation.

I think we've been talking about this for years, but I hope that \nSPEAKER_04:  We can continue to push for our \nSPEAKER_04:  add more adequate funding to help address these issues. \nSPEAKER_04:  and also \nSPEAKER_04:  to see if we can innovate and come up with good solutions. This is not just a problem with the rodents themselves, but also with human behaviors and how we dispose. \nSPEAKER_04:  How we live in a urban setting and try and \nSPEAKER_04:  try and limit the opportunities for \nSPEAKER_04:  Rotten infestations.

So I'm happy to join President Flan and Council of Lebride and to tackle this issue. \nSPEAKER_01:  like consul if \nSPEAKER_01:  Flynn said this is a quality of life and a public health issue and my office gets calls and emails all the time not just from Austin Brighton which I know most of the calls do come from but from neighborhoods across you know every neighborhood in the city so I look forward to the work ahead. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Councillor Murphy. But anyone else likes to speak on this matter? See Councillor McKee at the floor, yours. \nSPEAKER_11:  Yeah. Thank you to the makers. Really excited to have this conversation. Just want to point out a few things. One, in terms of accountability, we also need to lean into \nSPEAKER_11:  Developers, right, in terms of how they do business here in the City of Boston because when development happens in our city \nSPEAKER_11:  Um. \nSPEAKER_11:  We see a high influx of rotons. And I think that that's something that we need to lean into in terms of \nSPEAKER_11:  It needs to be on that target list and then I also want to uplift landlords, right? Landlords also have a role to play in this, so I think that it's great that we are including them. And then it's also important for us as a city to look at BHA. \nSPEAKER_11:  and management companies. There are a lot of folks, the CDC's that get money to \nSPEAKER_11:  support and be property managers, but I get calls all the time from parents and families who are dodging literally rats every single day and you know don't see themselves really being heard so I think that in terms of accountability we need to ensure that we're bringing the management companies into these conversations because they also have a role to play in how we deal with this situation and I think you know I always think back about \nSPEAKER_11:  During remote learning, there were a lot of young people who were afraid to turn on their cameras. \nSPEAKER_11:  because they were afraid. \nSPEAKER_11:  that they're \nSPEAKER_11:  their classmates would see Ruins, Kakarotches and mice. \nSPEAKER_11:  Um, \nSPEAKER_11:  pass them across the screen and I think that that speaks volumes to the social emotional impact that this is also making on our students. So I just wanted to lift that up. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Councillor Mejia. Councillor Lara, the floor is yours. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, Chair. I just wanted to thank President Flynn and the other co-sponsors. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think this is a unique opportunity for us to collaborate with other neighboring cities. I think as Councillor Brayden mentioned, this is an issue that is a regional issue. City Councillor at large from Somerville Charlotte Kelly, famously ran her campaign with a rat plan for Somerville. \nSPEAKER_02:  and some of you will have a free \nSPEAKER_02:  PES Control Assistance Program that they run, that they offer to homeowners, and so there's a lot of, there's opportunity for us to innovate, and there's also a lot of best practices that are already available. \nSPEAKER_02:  put in place by our counterparts in surrounding cities. And so my hope is that we can invite them to talk about what they've implemented and how we can recreate some of that here in the city of Boston as well. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Councillor. \nSPEAKER_05:  Chair and I recognize this Councillor Flaherty. \nSPEAKER_05:  Councillor Flaud in the floor is yours. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you Mr. Chair. Please add my name and just through the maker, just to suggest in that. \nSPEAKER_08:  We bring obviously ISD and maybe the fire department. The solution to this issue is dry ice. \nSPEAKER_08:  The problem is apparently someone has patented and it does called rat ice. \nSPEAKER_08:  So it now requires our road and control division when they want to administer this, which is the safest and most humane way to address the issue. \nSPEAKER_08:  They have to get in the vehicle, drive up to a woovern. \nSPEAKER_08:  and get what's called a label, which is basically a permit. \nSPEAKER_08:  and then have to turn around and then go down to Rockland. \nSPEAKER_08:  and pick up the dry ice. \nSPEAKER_08:  and then come back to the City of Boston. Colossal waste of time. \nSPEAKER_08:  So we need to figure out a way through ISD, maybe our fire department, maybe the council through ordinance. \nSPEAKER_08:  to allow the expectual service department. \nSPEAKER_08:  to get dry ice. \nSPEAKER_08:  right over at the new market area, which is where they used to get it before someone got cute. \nSPEAKER_08:  or what would have turned me on to put on it and they have now patented which now prevents municipalities like Boston to be able to utilize a very \nSPEAKER_08:  useful tool to combat. \nSPEAKER_08:  road infestation and for those who know anything about the Norwegian Ratt and how they migrate and how they repopulate all of that stuff, reproduce. \nSPEAKER_08:  You know that the baiting and the traps only go so far, but also when you have experts in here which we've had Experts in this chamber. They talk about \nSPEAKER_08:  They've almost become immune to some of the... \nSPEAKER_08:  the pesticides, the bait that we're using. In fact, they built up such a tolerance that, you know, in the old days, you would only take a little bait would work. Now, you literally have to put \nSPEAKER_08:  a basic pound of bait. \nSPEAKER_08:  to be able to sort of just to be able to maintain \nSPEAKER_08:  some sense of catching up. \nSPEAKER_08:  Dry ice eliminates all that. And so you think about the rats that have borrowed in the common, and all of our parks or around our BHA developments, walk along the BHA developments when you take tours in your district and see all the rat holes alongside the building. \nSPEAKER_08:  Dry ice will solve that problem almost instantaneously. So again, through the maker, if you could make sure that we get ISD, maybe the fight upon it. \nSPEAKER_08:  Maybe even state regulators, because there's a solution to this problem. \nSPEAKER_08:  It's very simple, it's dry ice. However, our hands are tied. \nSPEAKER_08:  because someone has patented his regulations that will be seen. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you, Mr. Chair. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you Councillor Flourity. The Chair recognizes Councillor Flynn. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Councilor Royo, and I certainly agree with my colleague, Councilor Flarety. \nSPEAKER_10:  We will have that discussion here. \nSPEAKER_10:  both dry ice. We will have the appropriate city agencies and that is our plan is to try to \nSPEAKER_10:  come up with a solution where we have easy access. City officials have easy access to dry ice. That's a huge, that's a huge \nSPEAKER_10:  Asset for us in dealing with \nSPEAKER_10:  dealing with this issue. I was in the south end. \nSPEAKER_10:  in one of the public hours last two weeks ago. \nSPEAKER_10:  and the amount of rodents and rats in that area, the only way they could kill them is through dry ice. \nSPEAKER_10:  But the other aspect I feel to mention that I want to mention now since the opportunity, the city is coming up with the composting city wide. \nSPEAKER_10:  So we also want to make sure that when the City of Boston comes out with a composting plan. \nSPEAKER_10:  that there's a huge educational aspect to it. \nSPEAKER_10:  It's not as simple as just disposing of the food waste. There's a process to it that residents need to be educated. The other aspect is \nSPEAKER_10:  We also need to educate our residents that don't speak English. And we have to have a campaign around the city in various languages so that we can educate people in different languages about this quality of life, this public health. I call it emergency really. \nSPEAKER_10:  So thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you to Councilor Flarety. And when we do have this committee hearing, \nSPEAKER_10:  Um \nSPEAKER_10:  My goal was to keep it in. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um \nSPEAKER_10:  Keep it open. \nSPEAKER_10:  so that we can meet on it every month or so with various experts. Continue to learn about it and continue to make progress on it. \nSPEAKER_10:  I had the opportunity to talk to the City of Newton last month. \nSPEAKER_10:  The City of New York has an excellent. \nSPEAKER_10:  Road in test control program. \nSPEAKER_10:  But a lot of good cities are doing great work on this issue. It's also about working together. So again, I want to say thank you to my colleagues for their interest and they work on this issue for a long period of time. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Mr. Joe. Thank you, Councillor Flynn. Chair recognizes Councillor Bach. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just wanted to dovetail on that to say that as the Chair of City Services. \nSPEAKER_00:  I very much think this is like the \nSPEAKER_00:  It is like the ultimate in like basic city services and like what does it mean to have a clean and sanitary city And so definitely look forward to working with the president and the co-sponsors around both holding that hearing and As he suggested keeping it open making sure that that's an ongoing conversation throughout the term for self \nSPEAKER_00:  Looking forward to it. Thank you, Mr. Chair. \nSPEAKER_05:  looking forward to it. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you Councillor Bach. Would anyone else like to add their name? \nSPEAKER_05:  God. \nSPEAKER_05:  Please add Councillor Bock, Councillor Edwards, Councillor Fernandez Anderson, Councillor Flarety, Councillor Lara, Councillor Lulligenne, Councillor Mejia, Councillor Morelle, please add my name. \nSPEAKER_05:  Alright. \nSPEAKER_05:  seeing no further. \nSPEAKER_05:  Docket 0467 will be assigned to the Committee on City Services and Innovation Technology. Thank you, Mr. Clerk. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Council Roy O. \nSPEAKER_10:  Mr. Clerk, please read, document. \nSPEAKER_09:  at zero four. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  success. \n",
                "SPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Document number 0468, Councilor Mejia, off of the following. \nSPEAKER_09:  in order for a hearing on establishing a mental health \nSPEAKER_09:  curriculum in Boston Public Schools. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  that she recognizes Councilman here, Councilman here. \nSPEAKER_10:  You have the floor. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you, Mr. President, and I would like to add my colleague, Councillor Erick Murphy. \nSPEAKER_11:  as a cold sponsor in the searing order? \nSPEAKER_10:  Council Murphy is so added. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  Since even before the COVID-19 pandemic, we've been dealing with a pandemic in our Boston Public Schools around mental health. \nSPEAKER_11:  and wellness. It's gotten so bad that the American Academy \nSPEAKER_11:  of pediatric's \nSPEAKER_11:  and adolescent psychiatry and children's hospital association have declared a national emergency and children's mental health, citing a serious toll \nSPEAKER_11:  of the COVID-19 pandemic on top of existing challenges. \nSPEAKER_11:  Every day students are being asked to leave their backpacks full of trauma at the door. \nSPEAKER_11:  so that they can focus on their studies. \nSPEAKER_11:  And recently we have seen how that untreated trauma has spilled. \nSPEAKER_11:  I'm over in our schools out into these streets. From the shooting outside of Tech Boston Academy to the loaded gun found at young achievers of science and math and school, to several tombstones of our last year. \nSPEAKER_11:  And you loved ones being defaced and even stolen. \nSPEAKER_11:  It is clear that we need to be doing a lot more to address mental health and wellness in our schools. In school, we teach students how to read, how to write, how to run, and even how to eat. \nSPEAKER_11:  But we do not do. \nSPEAKER_11:  What we do not do is give them the tools and resources to unpack their trauma in a non-violent and productive way. \nSPEAKER_11:  This is why we're filing this hearing order. \nSPEAKER_11:  In terms of the data, the numbers are pretty clear. According to the federal Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, emergency department's visits for suspected suicide attempts among adolescents jumped \nSPEAKER_11:  31% \nSPEAKER_11:  in 2020 compared to 2019. \nSPEAKER_11:  In February and March of this year, emergency department visits for suspected \nSPEAKER_11:  on suicide attempts were \nSPEAKER_11:  51% higher among girls. \nSPEAKER_11:  ages 12 to 17. \nSPEAKER_11:  during the same period. \nSPEAKER_11:  in 2019. \nSPEAKER_11:  I get choked up because I have a 12 year old daughter. So this is hard. \nSPEAKER_11:  Um \nSPEAKER_11:  And I'm also having my own experience with this issue. So I'm growing up, you already know my story. \nSPEAKER_11:  So this clearly indicates that we need to be moving beyond the conventional plans of providing school, psychologists, and social workers when needed. \nSPEAKER_11:  They do great work, but we need to be doing more. \nSPEAKER_11:  in California, a bill which recently passed requires each school district, county office of education, state specials, and \nSPEAKER_11:  School and charter school that offers one or more courses in health education to pupils in middle school or high school to include those courses, some form of instructional mental health. \nSPEAKER_11:  And way back in 1999 Massachusetts Commissioner of Education David Driscoh released a comprehensive health curriculum framework. \nSPEAKER_11:  which seeks to introduce mental health into the classroom. \nSPEAKER_11:  But it's clear that we're not doing enough or being intentional around mental health education in our schools. \nSPEAKER_11:  So I'm hoping to use this hearing as an opportunity to look at what more we can be doing to uplift mental health and wellness in our schools. \nSPEAKER_11:  and before I finish. \nSPEAKER_11:  I also just want to give a shout out to Councillor Murphy, who has made youth mental health a cornerstone of her office's work. \nSPEAKER_11:  And I'm hoping that as the Chair and Vice Chair of the Committee of Education, we will be able to work collaboratively on this issue together. \nSPEAKER_11:  Our success as legislators is measured by the quality of the world we leave behind for the next generation and we need to ensure that we have all the resources \nSPEAKER_11:  and they need to be set up for success. \nSPEAKER_11:  you \nSPEAKER_11:  And that very much includes mental health and wellness. Thank you. And I just wanted to say really quickly, because you know me, I always got a riff. \nSPEAKER_11:  off the top. \nSPEAKER_11:  I'll speak from my heart because that's just the way. \nSPEAKER_11: \u0e17\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19\u0e19\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07 \nSPEAKER_11:  Um \nSPEAKER_11:  You know, we have as parents oftentimes passed on our own trauma to our children because we weren't taught how to deal with it. \nSPEAKER_11:  You know, I talk about the fact that when I was a teen, I also attempted suicide, but my mom was so afraid. \nSPEAKER_11:  that I would be taken away from her that she never did anything about it. And I grew up believing that she didn't love me. \nSPEAKER_11:  And I think that if we're tackling mental health, we have an opportunity to destigmatize it. \nSPEAKER_11:  in a way \nSPEAKER_11:  that will help our \nSPEAKER_11:  The little ones understand that it's okay not to be okay. \nSPEAKER_11:  Um \nSPEAKER_11:  and that they need to be able to seek the support services that they need. And I think that this conversation is not just about \nSPEAKER_11:  a moment of \nSPEAKER_11:  of \nSPEAKER_11:  political theater, it really is looking at the violence that's spilling over into our streets. There is a deep connection. \nSPEAKER_11:  here. \nSPEAKER_11:  and we need to center mental health and wellness as part of that conversation. Otherwise, we're not getting to the root. \nSPEAKER_11:  So my hope is that as we continue to lean into this conversation, we recognize the responsibility and the opportunity that we have. \nSPEAKER_11:  to change doing business as usual. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Councilman here. \nSPEAKER_10:  The chair recognizes councilor Murphy, councilor Murphy, you have the floor. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  So we know our children are suffering with mental health issues and we cannot expect them to properly address their stress and mental health struggles if you don't teach them the tools they need to work through this. \nSPEAKER_01:  Teaching mental health will lead to better outcomes for our children. \nSPEAKER_01:  I know council mahea has mentioned some of them, but we know the statistics are scary. Suicide is the third leading cause of death for children ages 10 to 24. \nSPEAKER_01:  in many or most of mental health conditions start during adolescence. \nSPEAKER_01:  Knowledge is power, so I thank Councilor Mijia for being the lead sponsor on this important issue. And I look forward to working with her and my other colleagues to make sure that this happens for our students in the Boston Public Schools and across the city. So thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Council Murphy. \nSPEAKER_10:  The chair recognizes Councillor Fernandez-Anneson, Councillor Fernandez-Anneson, you have the floor. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you, Mr. President. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Councilor Mejia for your courage to \nSPEAKER_03:  open up to such a vulnerable state with us. \nSPEAKER_03:  and to be so beautiful and so pure. \nSPEAKER_03:  to be able to share yourself with us in a way that \nSPEAKER_03:  Uh \nSPEAKER_03:  really \nSPEAKER_03:  exemplifies what a leader should \nSPEAKER_03:  conduct to herself as and I really appreciate you know the way you took us through that and \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm just humbled to hear you, to be able to have so much courage, to be that vulnerable with us because a lot of us speak about mental health and it's become a political jargon that \nSPEAKER_03:  I think everyone now it's a catchphrase that we know \nSPEAKER_03:  that we all must support, that we all to an issue, to an issue, to an issue. So we all talk about it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  the way that I've seen yourself in Constra Murphy. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  guide us through this or at least the way I've watched you do it, I really appreciate you for that. In terms of what you file today, \nSPEAKER_03:  I really look forward to the work. I would love to, please add, my name is Mr. President. I would love to work with you on it. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think that one of the issues is not just, you know, the problem is not adding one social worker for school or \nSPEAKER_03:  as you say, bringing the homeschool connection or creating that platform. \nSPEAKER_03:  The CBHI, CBHI, so children behavior health initiative for through mass health. \nSPEAKER_03:  covers only medical necessities. So this means that the service, the clinician will then go in and \nSPEAKER_03:  have to diagnose in order for the service to be rendered. The issue with that is fee for service and perpetuates the cyclical effect of \nSPEAKER_03:  prison pipeline because you have to diagnose \nSPEAKER_03:  or sometimes misdiagnose or harshly diagnosed a child. So I question and I really want us to talk about how are we diagnosing our black and brown children and how many \nSPEAKER_03:  How many fees do you have to take in order to render that service? Sometimes the issues are as you are putting it in your here, in your \nSPEAKER_03:  request for the hearing. \nSPEAKER_03:  in the order is that \nSPEAKER_03:  You sometimes, the issue is circumstantial. It's situational. So it deserves a temporary NOS just to get that three-month service, to figure out why that kid is in the shelter, or why that kid's acting up, or why what's the problem circumstantially, temporarily for that moment? \nSPEAKER_03:  But what happens is once they get the diagnosis, it follows them throughout their lives, and then they end up going, you know, not getting a job or not or whatever. You know how to cooky crumbles. \nSPEAKER_03:  But I can't say enough how passionate I am about it. \nSPEAKER_03:  I am a strong advocate and I look forward to the work with you. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Council, Fernandez Anderson and Mr. Clerk, please add, Council, Fernandez Anderson. \nSPEAKER_10:  Her name would anyone else like to speak on this matter? \nSPEAKER_10:  with anyone else like to it. \nSPEAKER_10:  A te emang, shall we go to the saker? \nSPEAKER_10:  Councillor Aroyo, Councillor Boehre, Councillor Braden, Councillor Edwards. \nSPEAKER_10:  Council for Nandison, Council Flarey, Council Vara, Council Lujen. \nSPEAKER_10:  Councilor Rowan, please add the chair. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um \nSPEAKER_10:  Darker 0468 will be referred to the committee on education. \nSPEAKER_10:  Mr. Clerk, please readdoctor 0469. \n",
                "SPEAKER_10:  \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Dock number 0469, Councillors, Whirl and Mehea, offer the following. Order for a hearing regarding barriers to business. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  that she recognizes council. \nSPEAKER_06:  Council we're all. \nSPEAKER_06:  You have the floor. Thank you, President Plain, and thank you to my co-sponsor, Councilor Mejia, for her work around small businesses here in the city. The Institute of Justice recently released a report called Bariast Business to study how regulatory burdens impact entrepreneurs across 20 cities, including Boston. \nSPEAKER_06:  The report documents that fees range from $945 to $554 to start a restaurant. \nSPEAKER_06:  The report scores Boston 1 out of 5 in a one-stop shop analysis reporting that the city's website does not effectively centralize information for entrepreneurs in an intuitive and organized way. The report also reveals the extremely complex process for starting a business stating restaurants must complete 92 steps and barbershops 81 steps. There are also additional areas in Boston and it's something that Councillor Anderson always brings up is the clean hands requirement that means applicants for permits or licenses can be denied even if they owe a small amount of fines or fees to the city. \nSPEAKER_06:  These burdensome requirements, especially impact low income, MWBE, entrepreneurs, that we need to do everything possible to streamline processes and explore costs associated with starting a business. We must do better to ensure that we support small business growth to allow our main streets to flourish and contribute to our city. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Councilor Laurel. \nSPEAKER_10:  Be. \nSPEAKER_10:  Chair recognizes Councilor Meher. Councilor Meher, you have the floor. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you to Councilor Rural for adding us as one of the original co-sponsors. As the former chair of the Committee of Small Business, I'm really excited that you are now taking the lead on this and so incredibly grateful for your leadership and the space. \nSPEAKER_11:  Um, \nSPEAKER_11:  you know during my time. \nSPEAKER_11:  And as the committee chair, we were doing so during the hardest. \nSPEAKER_11:  point here in the city of Boston with the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_11:  And I saw firsthand how the barriers to businesses negatively impact communities of color. \nSPEAKER_11:  both for people who are \nSPEAKER_11:  established business owners and for those who are looking to start their own business. We worked. \nSPEAKER_11:  to try to eliminate these barriers to business ownership, including passing the language access, ordinance, and as well as establishing the retail residential kitchens, ordinance here in the city of Boston. But we know that there's not one policy that can be implemented that's going to lift the decades of policy decisions that have been contributing to the equities that we are seeing today. \nSPEAKER_11:  as retail spaces become more expensive, as you know. \nSPEAKER_11:  can't even afford. \nSPEAKER_11:  a bathroom. \nSPEAKER_11:  these days to set up shop because everything is so expensive in the city no matter who you are. \nSPEAKER_11:  I think that the process of obtaining licenses remain as confusing as ever. \nSPEAKER_11:  And we need to act to ensure that our city is a model for entrepreneurs and small businesses. And I look forward to this hearing and to working alongside Councillor Warau and the whole council are reducing these barriers to businesses. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Councilman here. Would anyone else like to speak on this matter? \nSPEAKER_10:  Would anyone else like to... \nSPEAKER_10:  Sponsored, please raise your hand. \nSPEAKER_10:  Mr. Clerk, please add Councillor Eroio, Councillor Bock, Councillor Braden, Councillor Edwards, Councillor Fernandez-Nicson, Councillor Flarete, Councillor Lara, Councillor Luj\u00e1n. \nSPEAKER_10:  Councilor Murphy and please add the chair. \nSPEAKER_10:  Dr. Zero, four, six nine will be referred to the Committee on Small Business and Professional License. \nSPEAKER_10:  We're on to personnel orders. Mr. Clerk, please read the document. Zero. \n"
